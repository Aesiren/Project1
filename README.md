# Project1 Description:
Project 1 for SDI 31
This "website" is a centralized resource for up-and-coming Pokemon Trainers. It includes detailed breakdowns of all starting, legendary, and mythic pokemon, as well as the ability to show random pokemon. Included are two games: a guessing game to determine if the user can recognize pokemon by site, and a matching game to help improve memory.
